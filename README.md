# Priorities:
- BackEnd requests aren't giving any meaningful responses or logs 
when it comes to security issues

# Optimization
- Logging
- Monitoring

# Automation
- Docker
- Environments introduction (dev, prod)
- Terraform

# Testing strategies
- Performance testing
- Integration testing
- OWASP Top 10 testing

# Security
- JWT (https://www.toptal.com/spring/spring-security-tutorial)
  - JWT testing
  - JWT validation
  - JWT session duration
  - JWT refresh token
  - JWT blacklisting
- Rate Limiting
- Database security
- External API calls security

# Improvements
- Code Quality (KtLint)
- Code Coverage (JaCoCo)
- Admin UI
- fix dependencies in build.gradle
- API versioning
